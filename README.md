# GNNs

This repository contains exploration and learning about Graph neural network. 

Notebook-ogb_arxiv.ipynb contains code for node classification task where tweeks for loss function from ’Bag of Tricks for Node
Classification with Graph Neural Networks’ was implemented and matched performance with OGB Leaderboard for Node Property
Prediction. Library used: dgl, Pytorch
